# Training-set-optimization
This is Zixuan Chen's internship project, Training set optimization

This project includes two experiment designs. Experiment 1 is to explore the impact of the training set size. Experiment 2 is to explore the population structure.

The code 'JWAS_Model_git.R', 'deep_ped_functions.ODB.R', and 'getbdat_AOB_V3_git.R' are the source of the functions for modeling. They should be imported into the project.

The function 'inbred_vals' in the 'getbdat_AOB_V3_git.R' file need to run for once and the result should be saved. 
Attention: Function 'inbred_vals' requests ASREML license!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ask for permission before using it.

The files generated during the modeling process are deleted. If the details are of interest, please modify the codes.
